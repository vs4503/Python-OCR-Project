# Python-OCR-Project - In Progress

This project is designed to scan driver's license (DL) images from a webcam and display the extracted details on the front-end. It utilizes React for the front-end, Flask for the backend, and Pytesseract along with EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR).

## Usage
1) Allow the application to access your webcam.
2) Hold a driver's license in front of the webcam.
3) Click the "S" button to capture an image.
4) The application will perform OCR on the image and display the extracted details on the front-end.

## Technologies Used
- React: Front-end user interface development.
- Flask: Backend server to handle image processing and OCR.
- Pytesseract: Python library for OCR.
- EasyOCR: Python library for more advanced OCR capabilities.
